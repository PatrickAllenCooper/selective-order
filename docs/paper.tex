\begin{abstract}
Modeling the stock market is considered one of the most difficult and yet important tasks of data science. In spite of this, no consistent method has been found which continually yields returns. Here we propose a better than state of the art method which makes us of auxiliary learners to construct a cohesive set of embeddings that allow a LSTM to perform the heavy lifting of informing trading decisions.
